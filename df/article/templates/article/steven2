Some smaller fixes - got the banner in on interior pages.

It *was* the parens - and other punctuation like "&". Ugly - but allowed again.

Fixed on both summaries and detail pages.

Fixed both.

> Single match search result isn't defaulting to article.

Fixed

Fixed.

> <title> tag isn't displaying article title.

Fixed - many places.

> Home page / recent pages are displaying too many links. Instead of
> 50, let's try 20 per page.

I already tackled this - index has 10/page, 20 elsewhere.
